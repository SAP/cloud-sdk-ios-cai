## Overview

Thank you so much for being so interested in contributing to our project! It's people like you that make the open source community such a great community! üòä

We welcome any contribution, not only code. You can help and 
- **analyze issues**: take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-ios-cai/issues?state=open). Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.
- **report an issue**: do not hesitate to file a  [new issue](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-ios-cai/issues/new). Do not hesitate to provide as many details as possible.
- **provide feedback**: is the README insufficient, or is the API documentation unclear? Let us know!

## Submitting code and pull request handling

Submit all code contributions via Pull Requests (PRs). PRs _shall_ target the [`dev`](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-ios-cai/tree/dev) branch.

Quick checklist summary before submitting a PR:

* üîé Make sure tests are added or updated to accommodate your changes. When possible, add tests to verify bug fixes and prevent future regressions. For SwiftUI code changes, please add or improve SwiftUI Previews
* üëå Verify that tests pass (`make test` and `make uitest`), code is free of SwiftLint violations (`make lint`), and code is formatted accordingly to project rules (`make format`)
  * Install required tools for linting and formatting with `make devtools`
* üìñ Check that your commit message follows [Conventional Commit standards](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and has a meaningful description of what it is about
* üëç Push it!

We reserve the right to close pull requests (without processing).
